# Frontend Design + Aesthetics Skill

This skill guides Claude to generate distinctive, memorable, production‑grade frontend interfaces,
avoiding generic “AI slop” aesthetics and focusing on intentional, high‑quality UI design.

## When to Activate
Use this skill whenever generating frontend UI code: pages, components, layouts, dashboards, or design systems.

## Design Thinking
- Clarify purpose, audience, and constraints
- Choose a clear aesthetic direction (editorial, brutalist, playful, luxury, etc.)
- Prefer strong, opinionated design decisions over safe defaults

## Typography
- Use distinctive fonts; avoid generic system defaults
- Pair fonts intentionally
- Use fluid type scales (clamp)

## Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive palette
- Use CSS variables
- Prefer bold accents and clear hierarchy

## Motion
- Add purposeful animations (load, hover, scroll)
- Favor a few strong motions over many weak micro‑interactions

## Layout & Composition
- Use asymmetry, negative space, visual rhythm
- Break grids intentionally when appropriate

## Backgrounds & Depth
- Avoid flat solids by default
- Use gradients, patterns, or layered effects for depth

## Prompt Steering
You should avoid generic, on‑distribution UI outputs.
Focus on expressive, memorable frontend aesthetics across typography, color, motion, and layout.

## Output Expectations
Produce clean, working frontend code with intentional visual decisions.
