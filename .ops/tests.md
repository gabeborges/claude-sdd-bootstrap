## test 1
Date: Feb 06, 2026
Duration: 12:50pm - 1:50pm
Model: opus 4.6
Phase: planning
Details: starting fresh on project. /vision:distill + /orchestrate, no ui-design-system (had to be generated). Added product-vision-strategy.md and prd.md for reference.
Usage %: 35% (12% - 47%)
Notes: 
* implementation-status.md seems to have key decisions to be made but user was never asked. It would be nice to have instrucitons on how to answer these qustions or user being prompt about it.
* a lot of files not specified where created:
.ops/build/v0
- compliance-requirements.md (could be at the build lvl as compliance doesn't change based on features)
- component-architecture.md (could be an yaml and at the build lvl)
- security-patterns.md (from skills - it has checklist by task and acceptance criteria by task) - if it's a requirement, should it be part of specs.md??
- task-order.md (is it because tasks are not yaml? Seems like it's for AI) 
- ux-flow.md
