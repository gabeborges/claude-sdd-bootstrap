# Improved Prompt

Analyze the fullstack-developer agent at `claude/agents/fullstack-developer.md` and compare it with these three VoltAgent community subagent definitions:

1. nextjs-developer — https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents/blob/main/categories/02-language-specialists/nextjs-developer.md
2. javascript-pro — https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents/blob/main/categories/02-language-specialists/javascript-pro.md
3. react-specialist — https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents/blob/main/categories/02-language-specialists/react-specialist.md

Goal: Produce a gap analysis + integration recommendation report that identifies which knowledge and patterns from these specialist agents should be absorbed into the fullstack-developer agent to make it more effective for this project's stack: Next.js 14+ (App Router), React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Supabase, Stripe.

Constraints:
- The fullstack-developer MUST remain an SDD-compliant implementation agent (spec-driven, `implements:` pointers, escalation rules, no architectural decisions)
- Do NOT propose splitting into separate specialist agents — the goal is one enhanced agent
- Respect token/context budget — additions should be concise directives, not verbose tutorials
- Preserve existing Autonomy, Reads, Writes, Rules, Process, and Escalation sections
- Any additions must not conflict with CLAUDE.md project rules

Analysis should cover:
1. **Gap Analysis**: What stack-specific knowledge is missing from fullstack-developer that the three specialists provide?
2. **Overlap Map**: What do the specialists cover that fullstack-developer already handles (or that CLAUDE.md already enforces)?
3. **Integration Recommendations**: Specific additions organized by section (Rules, Process, Quality Standards) with exact wording ready to merge
4. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong if we absorb too much (token bloat, role creep, conflicting instructions)?
5. **Priority Ranking**: Which additions deliver the most value for this stack?

Output: Save the report to `.ops/analysis/fullstack-developer-integration-analysis.md`

## Quality Scores
- **Clarity**: 72%
- **Efficiency**: 65%
- **Structure**: 60%
- **Completeness**: 55%
- **Actionability**: 70%
- **Specificity**: 75%
- **Overall**: 66% (borderline → comprehensive depth selected)

## Original Prompt
```
analyse claude/agents/fullstack-developer and tell me if it we can integrate some of these agents https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents/blob/main/categories/02-language-specialists/nextjs-developer.md and https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents/blob/main/categories/02-language-specialists/javascript-pro.md and https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents/blob/main/categories/02-language-specialists/react-specialist.md so this agent is more focused on the tech stack that I use for projects. Generate the report inside .ops/analysis
```

## Alternative Approaches

**1. Selective Cherry-Pick (Recommended)**
Analyze all three specialists, extract only the directives that fill real gaps for your stack, merge into a single enhanced `fullstack-developer.md`. Keeps the agent lean.

**2. Layered Includes**
Create a `stack-knowledge.md` reference file that the fullstack-developer `@includes`. Separates domain knowledge from SDD process. More modular but adds a file.

**3. Conditional Sections**
Add stack-specific guidance as conditional blocks (e.g., "When implementing Next.js routes..." / "When implementing React components..."). More verbose but highly contextual.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Agent still passes SDD compliance (spec pointers, escalation rules intact)
- [ ] Token count of agent definition stays reasonable (< 2000 tokens)
- [ ] No instructions conflict with CLAUDE.md rules
- [ ] No architectural decision-making leaked into the agent
- [ ] The agent doesn't duplicate what `ui-designer` or `architect` already handle
- [ ] Test: spawn the agent on a sample task and verify it follows the enhanced rules

## Edge Cases

- Stack version drift: Next.js 14 vs 15 — recommendations should be version-aware
- Role boundary creep: React performance optimization advice could conflict with architect's domain
- UI designer overlap: Component patterns from react-specialist may duplicate ui-designer's scope
- Token bloat: All three specialists combined would exceed reasonable agent definition size
