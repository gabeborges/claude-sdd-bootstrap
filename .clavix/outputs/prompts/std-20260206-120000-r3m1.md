# Improved Prompt

Rewrite README.md to be shorter and more scannable. Apply these changes:

## 1. Cut Redundancy
- Remove "Installation Guide (Detailed)" section — it duplicates "Quick Start"
- Remove "Directory Structure" section — the tree is already in "What's Included"
- Collapse "Agent Swarm Overview" into a brief summary table (not full tier-by-tier breakdown)
- Remove "Customization" section — move key points to a single "Adapting to Your Stack" paragraph
- Target: under 200 lines (currently 672)

## 2. Make It Scannable
- Lead with a 3-step "Quick Start" (install, copy, run)
- Use tables instead of long bullet lists where possible
- Remove prose paragraphs that restate what headings already say

## 3. Fix /orchestrate Path Documentation

The `/orchestrate` command serves two modes with different path arguments. Currently the README shows only one path pattern. Fix all occurrences:

**Planning mode** (creates specs, system-design, tasks):
```
/orchestrate .ops/build/v{x}/
```
Runs Tier 1–2 agents (spec-writer, architect, project-task-planner) for the entire build version.

**Implementation mode** (builds a specific feature):
```
/orchestrate .ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/
```
Runs Tier 3–6 agents for a single feature that already has specs.md and tasks.yaml.

**Find and replace these incorrect lines:**
- Step 6 in Installation: `/orchestrate .ops/build/v0/<feature-name>/` for planning context → should be `/orchestrate .ops/build/v0/`
- "What's Next" section: same fix
- Quick Start step 5: same fix
- Commands Reference "Implementation Command": document both paths

Keep the feature-path version (`/orchestrate .ops/build/v{x}/<feature-name>/`) only where implementation (not planning) is referenced.
