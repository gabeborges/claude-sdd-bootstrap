# Improved Prompt

## Objective

Make Claude Code execute implementation tasks end-to-end without pausing for
routine permissions. When blocked on one item needing my input, continue working
on independent tasks in parallel.

## Problem

Claude currently stops and asks permission for:
- File creation, deletion, and modification
- Dependency installs (npm install)
- Running build/test/lint commands
- Database migration execution
- Git operations (commits, branch creation)

This breaks flow and makes multi-step tasks painfully slow.

## Desired Behavior

### Always proceed without asking:
- Create, edit, delete files within the project directory
- Install dependencies listed in package.json or required by the task
- Run build, test, lint, and type-check commands
- Create and switch git branches
- Run database migrations in development
- Create directories and scaffolding

### Always ask before:
- Pushing to remote repositories
- Modifying environment variables or secrets
- Deleting git branches
- Running destructive database operations in production
- Changing CI/CD configuration
- Any action affecting shared/external systems

### When blocked on a decision:
- Flag the blocker clearly
- Continue working on all independent tasks
- Return to the blocked item when I provide input

## Operating Principles
- Assume permission to act within the stated scope
- If scope is unclear, infer the smallest reasonable scope and proceed
- Do not pause for clarification unless ambiguity affects correctness
- Prefer action over asking — fix forward, don't wait

## Implementation Scope

Analyze and recommend concrete solutions:
1. Claude Code permission settings (`.claude/settings.json`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`)
2. CLAUDE.md behavioral directives that agents will follow
3. Any other configuration that reduces friction

## Success Criteria
- Claude can complete a full feature implementation (files + deps + tests + migrations)
  without stopping for routine permissions
- When needing my input on one task, other independent tasks continue in parallel
- Destructive or external-facing actions still require my approval

- **Clarity**: 75%
- **Efficiency**: 70%
- **Structure**: 55%
- **Completeness**: 45%
