# Improved Prompt

Analyze the agent definitions in `.claude/agents/` directory. For each agent file:

1. **Catalog**: List every agent with its name, purpose, tools it uses, and what triggers it (slash command, workflow step, etc.)

2. **Evaluate against removal criteria** — an agent is a candidate for conversion to a skill if ANY of these are true:
   - It performs a single, stateless task (no multi-step orchestration)
   - It doesn't need to manage its own tool calls or context window
   - It duplicates logic already available in a Clavix slash command
   - It could be replaced by a prompt template + instructions (i.e., it has no unique tool access beyond Read/Write/Edit/Bash)
   - It is never referenced by other agents or workflows

3. **Output a recommendation table**:

   | Agent File | Purpose | Verdict | Rationale |
   |------------|---------|---------|-----------|
   | `agent-name.md` | What it does | KEEP / CONVERT TO SKILL / REMOVE | Why |

4. **For each "CONVERT TO SKILL" recommendation**, briefly describe:
   - What the equivalent skill slash command would look like
   - What functionality (if any) would be lost in conversion

Constraints:
- Only analyze files in `.claude/agents/` — do not modify anything
- "Skill" means a Clavix slash command template (markdown file in `.clavix/commands/`)
- An "agent" is a Claude Code agent definition (markdown file in `.claude/agents/`)
