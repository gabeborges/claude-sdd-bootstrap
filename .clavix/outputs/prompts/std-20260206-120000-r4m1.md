# Improved Prompt

Objective: Create a new README.md for the claude-sdd-bootstrap project that reflects
its simplified architecture after removing several components.

Context - What Was Removed:
- OpenSpec integration (openspec/ directory, /openspec:* commands)
- AGENTS.md (global guardrails file)
- Agent swarm system (.claude/agents/, including swarm-config.md and instructions.md)
- Claude skills (.claude/skills/)
- Claude commands (.claude/commands/)
- .mcp.json configuration file

Context - What the Project IS:
Read the current README.md to understand the project's purpose. This is a bootstrap
project that defines process, guardrails, and tooling for Specification-Driven
Development (SDD). It is NOT a product — it's installed into product repos.

Context - What Remains:
- CLAUDE.md (runtime execution guardrails)
- Clavix integration (slash commands provided by the Clavix npm package)
- .ops/ directory structure (product vision, build artifacts, specs)
- SDD workflow and artifact chain (specs.md → system-design.yaml → tasks.yaml)
- Stack definition: Next.js App Router, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Supabase, Stripe, Google OAuth

README Requirements:
1. Explain what this project is (bootstrap toolkit, not a product)
2. Explain the SDD methodology and artifact chain
3. Describe how Clavix drives the workflow (slash commands: /clavix:start, /clavix:improve,
   /clavix:prd, /clavix:implement, /clavix:verify, /clavix:archive)
4. Document the .ops/ directory structure and its purpose
5. Explain CLAUDE.md's role as the guardrail file
6. Guide users on how to install/adopt this into their product repos
7. Include the tech stack and prerequisites (Node.js, npm, Clavix package)
8. Keep tone professional but approachable — this is developer documentation

Structure:
- Project title and one-line description
- What This Is (and what it isn't)
- Tech Stack
- Prerequisites
- SDD Workflow overview
- Directory Structure
- How to Use / Getting Started
- Clavix Commands reference
- Contributing (optional, brief)

Success Criteria:
- A developer unfamiliar with SDD can understand the project in 5 minutes
- No references to removed components (OpenSpec, AGENTS.md, agent swarm, skills, commands dir, .mcp.json)
- Accurately reflects the current simplified project state
- Guides the user from "what is this?" to "how do I use it?"
