# Improved Prompt

As a claude-code-specialist agent, audit every agent definition in `claude/agents/*.md`
to identify reusable behaviors that should be extracted into standalone skills
(slash commands in `.claude/commands/`).

## What to Analyze

For each agent file, identify behaviors that:
1. Are invoked independently of the full swarm orchestration
2. Could be triggered by a user directly (not only via orchestrator)
3. Contain self-contained logic that doesn't depend on tier ordering
4. Are duplicated or nearly duplicated across multiple agents

## Definitions

- **Agent**: A role definition in `claude/agents/*.md` used by the orchestrator during swarm runs
- **Skill**: A standalone slash command (`.claude/commands/*.md`) a user can invoke directly
- **Extraction candidate**: A behavior currently buried inside an agent that would deliver value as a standalone skill

## Output Format

For each extraction candidate, provide:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Source agent(s) | Which agent(s) contain this behavior |
| Proposed skill name | Slash command name (e.g., `/validate-specs`) |
| What it does | One-sentence description |
| Why extract it | What efficiency gain or reuse this enables |
| Standalone? | Can it run without other agents? (Yes/Partial/No) |

## Scope

- Only analyze files in `claude/agents/`
- Do not modify any files — this is a read-only analysis
- Do not propose skills that duplicate existing commands in `.claude/commands/`
- Focus on behaviors users would realistically invoke outside of `/orchestrate`

## Deliverable

A single analysis report listing all extraction candidates, ordered by
impact (highest value extractions first).

## Quality Scores
- **Clarity**: 55%
- **Efficiency**: 70%
- **Structure**: 40%
- **Completeness**: 35%
- **Actionability**: 45%
- **Specificity**: 50%
- **Overall**: 48% (needs-improvement)
