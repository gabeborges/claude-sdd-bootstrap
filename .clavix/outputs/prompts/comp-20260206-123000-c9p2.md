# Improved Prompt

Objective: Create a new README.md for the claude-sdd-bootstrap project that accurately
describes the full project and guides users toward adopting it in their product repos.

Context - What This Project IS:
This is a bootstrap/template project — NOT a product. It provides a complete SDD
(Specification-Driven Development) toolkit that users copy/install into real product
repositories. It standardizes process, agents, commands, skills, guardrails, and
MCP server configuration.

Context - Project Structure (Two Key Directories):
- `claude/` — Source templates that get copied to `.claude/` in product repos
- `.claude/` — Working configuration for THIS repo (same content, used locally)

When documenting, reference `claude/` as the source of truth that users install.

Context - What Was Actually Removed (from old version):
- OpenSpec integration (openspec/ directory and /openspec:* commands) — replaced by
  Clavix-native workflow

Context - What EXISTS in this project (document all of these):

1. **CLAUDE.md** — Runtime execution guardrails (auto-loaded every session)
   - Stack definition, security rules, coding standards, SDD artifact flow, architecture boundaries

2. **AGENTS.md** — Agent coordination & SDD workflow reference
   - Artifact priority table, agent roles, orchestration rules

3. **Agent Swarm** (`claude/agents/`) — 20 specialized agents:
   - Core: architect, spec-writer, project-task-planner, workflow-orchestrator, context-manager
   - Dev: fullstack-developer, frontend-designer, ui-designer, database-administrator
   - Quality: code-reviewer, qa, test-automator, debugger
   - Security/Compliance: security-engineer, security-auditor, compliance-engineer, compliance-auditor
   - Meta: claude-code-specialist, sdd-specialist
   - Orchestration files: swarm-config.md, instructions.md

4. **Skills** (`claude/skills/`) — 8 domain skills:
   - interface-design, frontend-design, ux-states, security-patterns,
     compliance-patterns, db-migration, debugging, sdd-protocols

5. **Commands** (`claude/commands/`) — Slash command templates:

   There are two layers of commands in this project:

   **a. Custom Clavix Command Overrides** (`claude/commands/clavix/`):
   These are custom command templates that OVERRIDE Clavix npm package defaults when
   copied to `.claude/commands/clavix/` in a product repo. They enforce SDD-specific
   behavior on top of standard Clavix:
   - `product.md` — `/clavix:product` generates the high-level product vision &
     technical strategy document at `.ops/product-vision-strategy.md`. Focuses on
     long-term direction, principles, and constraints (not features).
   - `prd.md` — `/clavix:prd` generates version-scoped Mini-PRDs at
     `.ops/build/v{x}/prd.md`. Checks for existing product vision, asks focused
     questions about users/problems/features/metrics, and keeps scope to one version.

   **b. Project-Specific Commands** (other `claude/commands/` subdirectories):
   - interface-design/ (init, status, extract, audit)
   - gate/ (check, report)
   - db/ (plan)
   - debug/ (investigate)
   - security/ (review)
   - spec/ (validate)
   - vision/ (distill)
   - orchestrate.md (swarm entrypoint)

6. **Clavix Integration** — The Clavix npm package provides built-in workflow commands.
   This bootstrap EXTENDS Clavix by:
   - Adding 2 custom command overrides (product.md, prd.md) that enforce SDD workflows
   - The remaining Clavix commands work as-is from the npm package:
     /clavix:start, /clavix:improve, /clavix:plan, /clavix:implement, /clavix:refine,
     /clavix:verify, /clavix:review, /clavix:summarize, /clavix:archive

   The README should clearly explain this layering: Clavix provides the engine,
   this bootstrap provides the custom configuration that shapes its behavior.

7. **.ops/ directory** — SDD artifacts home:
   - product-vision-strategy.md (+ distilled domain splits)
   - build/v{x}/prd.md, build/v{x}/<feature>/specs.md
   - build/system-design.yaml
   - ui-design-system.md (optional)

8. **.mcp.json** — MCP server configuration template (Supabase, Sentry, etc.)

9. **Tech Stack**: Next.js App Router, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Headless UI,
   Supabase, Stripe, Google OAuth

Context - SDD Artifact Chain:
product-vision-strategy.md (/clavix:product) → prd.md per version (/clavix:prd) →
specs.md per feature (spec-writer agent) → system-design.yaml (architect agent) →
db-migration-plan.yaml if DB work (database-administrator agent) → tasks.yaml
(project-task-planner agent)

README Structure:
1. Project title and one-line description
2. What This Is (bootstrap toolkit, not a product — explain the claude/ → .claude/ pattern)
3. Tech Stack
4. Prerequisites (Node.js, npm, Clavix package, Claude Code or Cursor)
5. What's Included (agents, skills, commands, guardrails, MCP config)
6. How Clavix + This Bootstrap Work Together (layering: npm package + custom overrides)
7. SDD Workflow overview (the artifact chain, with which tool/agent produces each artifact)
8. Installation Guide (step-by-step: what to copy where)
9. Directory Structure (both claude/ source and .ops/ artifacts)
10. Commands Reference (both custom overrides and built-in Clavix commands)
11. Agent Swarm overview (roles and tiers)

README Requirements:
- Explain the `claude/` → `.claude/` bootstrap pattern clearly
- Explain the Clavix layering: npm package provides the engine, custom commands shape behavior
- Specifically describe what product.md and prd.md do and why they exist as overrides
- Document ALL components (agents, skills, commands, guardrails, MCP)
- Show the SDD workflow from vision to implementation
- Provide a clear installation guide for product repos
- No references to OpenSpec (removed)
- Keep tone professional but approachable — developer documentation
- Include a "Quick Start" path for users who want to get going fast

Success Criteria:
- A developer unfamiliar with SDD can understand the full project in 5-10 minutes
- The bootstrap pattern (claude/ → .claude/) is immediately clear
- The Clavix layering (npm defaults + custom overrides) is clearly explained
- All 20 agents, 8 skills, and command groups are at least listed
- User knows exactly what to copy into their product repo and in what order
- User understands that product.md and prd.md are custom SDD-enforcing overrides
- No references to removed OpenSpec integration

## Quality Scores
- **Clarity**: 92%
- **Efficiency**: 80%
- **Structure**: 88%
- **Completeness**: 93%
- **Actionability**: 87%
- **Specificity**: 92%
- **Overall**: 89% (good)

## Original Prompt
```
take .clavix/outputs/prompts/comp-20260206-121500-b7k3.md and update it based on this: inside claude/clavix there are two commands prd.md and product.md. These are customizations I've made on top of clavix. It will be pasted in to .claude/commands/clavix in a real project and will enforce the behaviour that I want. I think README.md talks about it. Update this
```

## Alternative Approaches

**1. Component-Focused README**
Organize by installable component (agents, skills, commands, guardrails) with each getting its own section and installation instructions. Best for: users who want to cherry-pick components.

**2. Workflow-Focused README**
Lead with the SDD workflow story (vision → specs → architecture → tasks → code) and weave components in as they appear. Best for: users who want to understand the methodology first.

**3. Quick Start + Reference**
Brief "copy these 5 things" quick start, followed by deep reference sections. Best for: experienced users who just want to get going.

## Validation Checklist

Before considering the README done, verify:
- [ ] The `claude/` → `.claude/` pattern is explained within the first 2 sections
- [ ] Clavix layering is explained: npm package defaults + custom command overrides
- [ ] product.md override is described (what it does, output path)
- [ ] prd.md override is described (what it does, output path, version scoping)
- [ ] All 20 agents are listed (at minimum by name)
- [ ] All 8 skills are listed
- [ ] All command groups are documented (both custom overrides and project commands)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md roles are explained
- [ ] .mcp.json is mentioned with setup instructions
- [ ] SDD artifact chain is shown with which tool/agent produces each step
- [ ] Installation steps are numbered and concrete
- [ ] No mention of OpenSpec
- [ ] .ops/ directory structure is documented

## Edge Cases
- User might try to use `claude/` directly instead of copying to `.claude/`
- User might not have Clavix installed — need clear prerequisite section
- User might be using Cursor instead of Claude Code — note compatibility
- Some files exist in both `claude/` and `.claude/` — explain this isn't duplication
- User might not understand why product.md and prd.md override Clavix defaults — explain the value
