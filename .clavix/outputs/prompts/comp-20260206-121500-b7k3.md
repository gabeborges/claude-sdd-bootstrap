# Improved Prompt

Objective: Create a new README.md for the claude-sdd-bootstrap project that accurately
describes the full project and guides users toward adopting it in their product repos.

Context - What This Project IS:
This is a bootstrap/template project — NOT a product. It provides a complete SDD
(Specification-Driven Development) toolkit that users copy/install into real product
repositories. It standardizes process, agents, commands, skills, guardrails, and
MCP server configuration.

Context - Project Structure (Two Key Directories):
- `claude/` — Source templates that get copied to `.claude/` in product repos
- `.claude/` — Working configuration for THIS repo (same content, used locally)

When documenting, reference `claude/` as the source of truth that users install.

Context - What Was Actually Removed (from old version):
- OpenSpec integration (openspec/ directory and /openspec:* commands) — replaced by
  Clavix-native workflow

Context - What EXISTS in this project (document all of these):

1. **CLAUDE.md** — Runtime execution guardrails (auto-loaded every session)
   - Stack definition, security rules, coding standards, SDD artifact flow, architecture boundaries

2. **AGENTS.md** — Agent coordination & SDD workflow reference
   - Artifact priority table, agent roles, orchestration rules

3. **Agent Swarm** (`claude/agents/`) — 20 specialized agents:
   - Core: architect, spec-writer, project-task-planner, workflow-orchestrator, context-manager
   - Dev: fullstack-developer, frontend-designer, ui-designer, database-administrator
   - Quality: code-reviewer, qa, test-automator, debugger
   - Security/Compliance: security-engineer, security-auditor, compliance-engineer, compliance-auditor
   - Meta: claude-code-specialist, sdd-specialist
   - Orchestration files: swarm-config.md, instructions.md

4. **Skills** (`claude/skills/`) — 8 domain skills:
   - interface-design, frontend-design, ux-states, security-patterns,
     compliance-patterns, db-migration, debugging, sdd-protocols

5. **Commands** (`claude/commands/`) — Slash command templates:
   - clavix/ (prd.md, product.md)
   - interface-design/ (init, status, extract, audit)
   - gate/ (check, report)
   - db/ (plan)
   - debug/ (investigate)
   - security/ (review)
   - spec/ (validate)
   - vision/ (distill)
   - orchestrate.md (swarm entrypoint)

6. **Clavix Integration** — Workflow commands (provided by Clavix npm package):
   - /clavix:start, /clavix:improve, /clavix:prd, /clavix:plan,
     /clavix:implement, /clavix:refine, /clavix:verify, /clavix:review,
     /clavix:summarize, /clavix:archive

7. **.ops/ directory** — SDD artifacts home:
   - product-vision-strategy.md (+ distilled domain splits)
   - build/v{x}/prd.md, build/v{x}/<feature>/specs.md
   - build/system-design.yaml
   - ui-design-system.md (optional)

8. **.mcp.json** — MCP server configuration template (Supabase, Sentry, etc.)

9. **Tech Stack**: Next.js App Router, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Headless UI,
   Supabase, Stripe, Google OAuth

Context - SDD Artifact Chain:
product-vision-strategy.md → prd.md (per version) → specs.md (per feature) →
system-design.yaml → db-migration-plan.yaml (if DB work) → tasks.yaml

README Structure:
1. Project title and one-line description
2. What This Is (bootstrap toolkit, not a product — explain the claude/ → .claude/ pattern)
3. Tech Stack
4. Prerequisites (Node.js, npm, Clavix package, Claude Code or Cursor)
5. What's Included (agents, skills, commands, guardrails, MCP config)
6. SDD Workflow overview (the artifact chain)
7. Installation Guide (step-by-step: what to copy where)
8. Directory Structure (both claude/ source and .ops/ artifacts)
9. Clavix Commands quick reference
10. Agent Swarm overview (roles and tiers)

README Requirements:
- Explain the `claude/` → `.claude/` bootstrap pattern clearly
- Document ALL components (agents, skills, commands, guardrails, MCP)
- Show the SDD workflow from vision to implementation
- Provide a clear installation guide for product repos
- No references to OpenSpec (removed)
- Keep tone professional but approachable — developer documentation
- Include a "Quick Start" path for users who want to get going fast

Success Criteria:
- A developer unfamiliar with SDD can understand the full project in 5-10 minutes
- The bootstrap pattern (claude/ → .claude/) is immediately clear
- All 20 agents, 8 skills, and command groups are at least listed
- User knows exactly what to copy into their product repo and in what order
- No references to removed OpenSpec integration

## Quality Scores
- **Clarity**: 90%
- **Efficiency**: 80%
- **Structure**: 85%
- **Completeness**: 90%
- **Actionability**: 85%
- **Specificity**: 90%
- **Overall**: 87% (good)

## Original Prompt
```
take the .clavix/outputs/prompts/std-20260206-120000-r4m1.md and change something: This is a bootstrap project. The files inside claude/ folder will be pasted in .claude/ in a real project. So when you can't find a file inside .claude in this project but it exists in claude/ folder, that is what I mean. So all your assumptions about .claude files bein remove is wrong. I just removed openspec and made some folder organization. Improve the prompt to reflect this understanding.
```

## Alternative Approaches

**1. Component-Focused README**
Organize by installable component (agents, skills, commands, guardrails) with each getting its own section and installation instructions. Best for: users who want to cherry-pick components.

**2. Workflow-Focused README**
Lead with the SDD workflow story (vision → specs → architecture → tasks → code) and weave components in as they appear. Best for: users who want to understand the methodology first.

**3. Quick Start + Reference**
Brief "copy these 5 things" quick start, followed by deep reference sections. Best for: experienced users who just want to get going.

## Validation Checklist

Before considering the README done, verify:
- [ ] The `claude/` → `.claude/` pattern is explained within the first 2 sections
- [ ] All 20 agents are listed (at minimum by name)
- [ ] All 8 skills are listed
- [ ] All command groups are documented
- [ ] CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md roles are explained
- [ ] .mcp.json is mentioned with setup instructions
- [ ] SDD artifact chain is shown
- [ ] Installation steps are numbered and concrete
- [ ] No mention of OpenSpec
- [ ] .ops/ directory structure is documented

## Edge Cases
- User might try to use `claude/` directly instead of copying to `.claude/`
- User might not have Clavix installed — need clear prerequisite section
- User might be using Cursor instead of Claude Code — note compatibility
- Some files exist in both `claude/` and `.claude/` — explain this isn't duplication
